# The Marketing Pod Dev - Technical Task

Thanks for applying for a developer role at The Marketing Pod. The purpose of this test is just to check how you would implement the following in a React application. You are free to spend as much time as you would need but we advise the task should take more that 4 - 6 hours at most.

Once you have completed the task please add to Git and share the repo with us.

## Brief

The task is to create a simple dashboard application which will display a list of users. You should be able to click on a user and it will open up a modal with the option to edit or delete the user. Clicking `edit` will take you to a new page with the information on the user displayed in a form. There should be the option to also delete the user here.

### Additional information

- Please use this to simulate the API - [https://dummyjson.com/docs/] - specifically the `user` endpoint.
- You are free to use which ever router you want, please make sure you have a `dashboard` page which has all the users listed and a `user` page which is used to get the data about that user.
- The site should be responsive and look good on all devices, however it just needs to be basic responsive and not break on smaller screens
- Please use Tailwind for styling - [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation] - this is already installed for you

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` start Vite
- `npm run build` builds project

### Bonus points

Bonus points are available for the following:

- A sidebar menu which opens and closes
- Adding the ability to save the user, there is information on how to replicate this here - [https://dummyjson.com/docs/users#update]
- Creating a nice, clean UI that works well accross all devices
- Any other nice touches to the UI that you feel enhance it
- Dark mode!

Remember this test is just about how you would approach the above work. If you are unable to complete the test in the time that is ok, please be prepared to discuss your solution and the challenges you may have faced whilst completing it.
